    <p>Hi all! Welcome to my page! My name is Zahra Mohamed which means to blossom in my native language. I share a birthday
        with my twin sister Habiba but it should be noted I was born first! I love reading eastern novels and watching science
        fiction anything. Although I speak four languages I only dream in Chimini which is a language with origins in Swahili
        and Arabic. I was a research coordinator working with person living with HIV/AIDS before going into developer land.
        I am thus going into this new career path with zero experience and lots of ambition!</p>
