    <p>Hi all! Welcome to my page! My name is Zahra Mohamed which means to blossom in my native language. I share a birthday with my twin sister Habiba but it should be noted I was born first! I love reading eastern novels and watching science fiction anything. Although I speak four languages I only dream in Chimini which is a language with origins in Swahili and Arabic. I was a research coordinator  working with person living with HIV/AIDS before going into developer land. I am thus going into this new career path with zero experience and lots of ambition!</p>
